Objectives: 
* Students will run basic queries to make a database, tables, and populate those tables.
* Students will use join SQL clauses

1. Run all your commands in MySQL but also put all of them in chronological order inside of a fun_time.sql file
2. Create a database called fun_time
3. Inside fun_time, create a bars table with id, bar_name
4. bars table must have at least 3 different bars (3 rows with different names)
5. Create a 4th bar with the name of 'Moo Milk Bar' 
6. Inside fun_time, create a drinks table with id, bar_id, drink_name, drink_price
7. Create 3 different drinks in the drinks table (3 rows with different drink names, prices and bar_ids)
8. Create another drink in the drinks table with a bar_id of the 'Moo Milk Bar'
9. Create 1 drink that has no bar_id (because it's not available in any of the bars in your bars table)
10. Use the following SQL JOINS: 

LEFT join bars to drinks

RIGHT join bars to drinks 

Select all the drinks

INNER JOIN drinks to bars

FULL JOIN drinks to bars
